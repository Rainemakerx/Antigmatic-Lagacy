This mod is a parody of another mod designed to bring levity alongside the original mod's new magical-themed content. Its inception came about from a challenge to allow "non-believers" to access an item in the original mod. Essentially this is the original mod, with some names changed, and a few methods that lock said item away, removed. Contains Etherium Library which was developed by Azistral who is also the original author of the mod I've forked. All artworks, writings, items, and largely the code itself belong to their respective owners, which I am not.
